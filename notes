Notes!

Todo:

Oh my word. Update Todo with everything to do.

Integrate functionality from root/App.js to rest of code.
Split out routing to routes/index.js
Split out and integrate App.js state management into Redux store
Split out and integrate App.js fetch requests into seperate file. Probably put into utils.
Restyle all new components to follow glassmorphic UI design
Add fix for Firefox backdrop-filter to allow glasmorphic blur - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38145368/css-workaround-to-backdrop-filter
Fully comment code for team - currently working on reducers - listsReducers.js
Figure out way to integrate state into backend with Redux OR figure out way to replace Redux entirely
Remove cdn script tags from public/index.html and integrate fully via packages
Make and update favicon
Think of name for app and create a logo
Write Redux functionality to delete boards
Write Redux functionality to move boards


Git:

never write code on the main branch

git branch // to check the current branch
git checkout -b branchname //to make a new branch
git add
git commit -m "meaningful message" // to commit my branch
git push --set-upstream origin branchname // to push the branch
create a pull request base:main compare:branchname
git pull origin main // 
npm i // will install dependencies
